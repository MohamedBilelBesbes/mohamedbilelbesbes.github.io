Two weeks ago, I was thrilled to come back to my school of origin, [Sup'Com](https://www.supcom.tn/), as a session facilitator within [Cognira](https://www.linkedin.com/company/cognira)'s workshop "Navigating the future with [Cognira](https://www.linkedin.com/company/cognira)'s Workflow for Data-Driven Applications" as part of the annual [Sup'Com](https://www.supcom.tn/) forum. It was indeed heartwarming to be the one transferring knowledge in the same classroom in which I was seeking knowledge as a student less than two years ago. I wanted to thank Team Sup'Com for the amazing event organization and their professionalism.
