This project is part of SOEN 691 research course at Concordia University - Fall 2024. Machine-learning based systems are increasingly emerging, but their unique characteristics introduce new challenges in managing technical debt. This study aims to refine technical debt analysis specifically in ML-centric projects hosted on GitHub, focusing on how refactoring impacts the evolution of technical debt. The approach builds on traditional software engineering debt frameworks, adapting them to address ML-specific concerns, such as data dependencies, reproducibility, and model degradation over time. By mining GitHub repositories and employing automated analysis tools such as PyRef and SonarQube, this research will identify prevalent forms of technical debt in ML projects, quantify their impact, and propose strategies for more effective management. Our goal is to enhance the sustainability and maintainability of ML systems by providing actionable insights to practitioners and researchers alike.
