Today marked my last day as a DevOps Engineer at Cognira. I feel thankful for launching my career in such a vibrant environment. In a period of nearly two years, I was among great people, some of whom I learned from, and some of whom I shared my knowledge with. I was lucky to be included in such an amazing team such as Cognira's DevOps team. I look forward to be included in such a place of growth, and I wish Cognira contiunous progress and success.

I did take a memory from Cognira with me (a physical one that is), it is the iconic mug I used to fill with coffee every morning. Throughout the last day, all my friends took turns to write something on it.
