## Get to know me more

I am a research assistant at  [REALISE Lab](https://realiselab.github.io/) at [Concordia University](https://www.concordia.ca/) in beautiful Montréal, Québec, Canada. But right before coming to Montréal to do research, I was in the industry for about one year and a half working as a DevOps engineer. Now, I'm back to academia working on how to improve the performance of every day usage applications.
