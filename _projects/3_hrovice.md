✔️ I built a hashtag#Django web application called HROvice' to ease the work of hashtag#HR Managers in Ovice, with a hashtag#Postgres DB (It generates documents like Interns' internships' attestations with the hashtag#Python hashtag#fpdf library ).
✔️ I built a hashtag#Kubernetes cluster on hashtag#AWS using hashtag#kops for deploying the application.
✔️ I wrote automation and configuration hashtag#Ansible scripts that removes old deployments and services, and make new updated ones using hashtag#kompose .
✔️ I Built a CI CD pipeline with hashtag#Jenkins that makes a hashtag#Docker image of the application from a hashtag#github branch and launch Ansible scripts for deployments and services creation on the cluster to deploy that image.

➡️ This project was my first time working on a micro-service oriented architecture, on Kubernetes, on Ansible, and on AWS.
