Last Friday, at the [International Conference on Performance Engineering](https://icpe2025.spec.org/) at [York University](https://www.yorku.ca/), Toronto, I presented our paper. The conference was an amazing opportunity to explore other influential research in Performance Engineering and it was a good venue for exchanging ideas and inspiring from seniors in both research and the industry.


Feel free to check the paper [here](https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.16332).

Side note: I wanted to really thank ICPE organization team for the outstanding ornaization. The boat dinner of second banquet in Lake Ontario was amazing!(yes, they did two banquets for one conference).
